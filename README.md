# switchboard-app-specs

This repository holds OpenAPI specifications (and potentially specifications for other protocols in the future) which are maintained by the community and moderated by Versori staff.

All public Apps in Switchboard should have their specification in this repository. If anyone in the community identifies a bug in a specification, issues or pull requests can be made here.

At the time of writing, Switchboard only support OpenAPI v3.0 specifications. There is plans to support 2.0 and 3.1, so contributions with other versions may be added, but they won't be functional within Switchboard until that version supported.
